    "While they behave somewhat similarly, the `await` keyword has significantly higher precedence than `yield`. This means that, because it is more tightly bound, there are a number of instances where you’d need parentheses in a `yield from` statement that are not required in an analogous `await` statement. For more information, see [examples of `await` expressions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/#examples-of-await-expressions) from PEP 492."
