Software engineer Tim Peters wrote this set of principles and posted it on the Python mailing list in 1999. Peters's list left open a 20th principle \"for Guido to fill in\", referring to Guido van Rossum, the original author of the Python language. The vacancy for a 20th principle has not been filled."
