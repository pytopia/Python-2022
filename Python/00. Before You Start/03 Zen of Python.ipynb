    "The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 \"guiding principles\" for writing computer programs that influence the design of the Python programming language. Software engineer Tim Peters wrote this set of principles and posted it on the Python mailing list in 1999. Peters's list left open a 20th principle \"for Guido to fill in\", referring to Guido van Rossum, the original author of the Python language. The vacancy for a 20th principle has not been filled."
