    "The notebooks can be great for starting projects and interactive exploration. However, as a project gets more advanced, you will eventually find that the linear nature of notebooks is a limitation because code can not really be reused. It is possible to define functions/classes within the notebook, but you lose the power of inspection (they are just seen as single blocks) and can’t share code across notebooks (and copy and paste is bad). This doesn’t mean to not use notebooks: but do keep this in mind, and once your methods are mature enough (you are using the same code in multiple places), try to move the core functions and classes out into a separate library, and import this into the day-to-day exploration notebooks. For more about problems with notebooks and how to avoid them, see this fun talk [“I don’t like notebooks” by Joel Grus](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n2RlMdmv1p25Xy5thJUhkKGvjtV-dkAIsUXP-AL4ffI/edit).

    "In a cluster environment, notebooks are inefficient for big calculations because you must reserve your resources in advance, but most of the time the notebooks are not using all their resources. Instead, use notebooks for exploration and light calculation. When you need to scale up and run on the cluster, separate the calculation from the exploration. Best is to create actual programs (start, run, end, non-interactive) and [submit those to the queue](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/tut/serial/). Use notebooks to explore and process the output. A general rule of thumb is “if you would be upset that your notebook restarted, it’s time to split out the calculation”."
